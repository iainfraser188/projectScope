TITLE:     JAVA FX BattleShips.

DESCRIPTION:  popular game battleships playable on macOS with two players.

WHY:    figuring out logic is where I feel I have
        struggled and a game will be mostly logic.
        also to learn how to use java to make
        a simple ai to play against.
        learn a new framework. i.e. javafx and web sockets.


MVP CRITERIA:   1.Game will display two grids.
                2.player will be able to place their ships on the grid.
                3.game will be turn based only the current player will be able to 
                interact.
                4.once all player ships are destroyed game will end and declare a winner.


EXTENTIONS:     1.add sound effects  
                2.add start menu
                3.add simple A.I player.

RISKS:          1.require research into javafx/sceneBuilder and webSockets


TECH STACK:     1. Javafx
                2. SceneBuilder
